# Hospital-Management-System
 The Hospital Management System is a simple console-based Java application designed to manage doctors, patients, and appointments efficiently.
 This project demonstrates the basic implementation of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Java, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction. It is ideal for beginners looking to learn Java or for showcasing in technical portfolios.

Features 🌟
Add and Manage Patients:

Register new patients with details like name, age, and illness.
View a complete list of registered patients.
Manage Doctors:

Predefined list of doctors with unique IDs and specializations.
Book Appointments:

Schedule appointments by selecting a registered patient and an available doctor.
Validate the existence of doctors and patients before booking.
View Appointments:

Display all booked appointments with patient and doctor details.

Technologies Used 💻
Programming Language: Java
Core Concepts:
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
Collections (ArrayList)
Input Handling with Scanner


How It Works 🛠️
Users interact with a menu-based system:
Add and manage patients.
Book and view appointments.
Data is stored in-memory using ArrayList for simplicity.
Program ensures error handling (e.g., invalid doctor or patient IDs).

Future Enhancements 🚀
Add a database for persistent storage.
Implement a GUI for better user experience.
Introduce authentication for system access.
